# Updated MELD Configuration for Trajectory Extraction

## Current Issue
Your simulation ran only 5 replica exchange steps, which generates very little trajectory data for extraction.

## Minimum Requirements for Trajectory Extraction

### Basic (minimal viable)
```bash
N_STEPS=20          # At least 20 replica exchange steps
BLOCK_SIZE=5        # Save every 5 steps → 4 blocks
TIMESTEPS=2500      # MD steps per exchange step
```
**Result**: 4 blocks × ~1-2 frames per block = 4-8 frames for extraction

### Recommended (for good sampling)
```bash
N_STEPS=100         # 100 replica exchange steps  
BLOCK_SIZE=10       # Save every 10 steps → 10 blocks
TIMESTEPS=2500      # MD steps per exchange step
```
**Result**: 10 blocks × ~2-5 frames per block = 20-50 frames for extraction

### Production (for publication-quality)
```bash
N_STEPS=1000        # 1000 replica exchange steps
BLOCK_SIZE=50       # Save every 50 steps → 20 blocks
TIMESTEPS=5000      # More MD steps per exchange
```
**Result**: 20 blocks × ~10-20 frames per block = 200-400 frames for extraction

## Time Estimates (rough)
- **Minimal (N_STEPS=20)**: ~30 minutes - 1 hour on 4 GPUs
- **Recommended (N_STEPS=100)**: ~2-5 hours on 4 GPUs  
- **Production (N_STEPS=1000)**: ~20-50 hours on 4 GPUs

## Quick Fix for Your Current Situation

Update your `.env` file:
```bash
N_STEPS=50          # Reasonable middle ground
BLOCK_SIZE=10       # Save every 10 steps
TIMESTEPS=2500      # Keep current timesteps
```

Then rerun:
```bash
python setup_meld.py  # Regenerate with new parameters
./run_mpi_meld.sh --gpus 0,1,2,3 --np 30 --allow-oversubscribe
```

This should give you ~5 blocks with enough frames for meaningful trajectory extraction.
